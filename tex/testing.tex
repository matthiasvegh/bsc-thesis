\label{chapter:Testing}

This chapter describes the testing involved in this project.
This project is tested using Robot Framework \cite{robotframework}.

As the project is composed of multiple programs, each part is tested
independently. This helps in comprehension of each test, as the reader can only
deal with one part at a time, and also eliminates a combinatorial explosion that
would emerge if every type of input that could emerge for the Clang-plugin then
needed to be tested by way of testing the variable-name suggestions.

Keywords used by these tests can be found in appendix
\ref{appendix:databasekeywords}.
