\epigraph{There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation
	and naming things.}{Phil Karlton}

Several programs were written as part of this thesis, which when used together,
assist a software developer in giving variables in their \CC{} code-base good
names.

The primary goal of this thesis is to provide a refactoring tool that is aware
of all variable declarations and their relations, so that accurate suggestions
can be made. This is achieved by providing a compiler-plugin for Clang, the
\CC{}-compiler of the LLVM compiler infrastructure \cite{llvm}.
