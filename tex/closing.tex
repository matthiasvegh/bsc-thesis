\section{Results}
Several programs were implemented, that comprise a tool for suggesting
variable-names for \CC{} codebases. This tool was tested automatically using
Robot \cite{robotframework}, and tested manually against xerces-c
\cite{xerces-c}. Variable-name suggestions were based on the type of the
variable in question, and suggestions and renaming was made available via a Vim
plugin.
